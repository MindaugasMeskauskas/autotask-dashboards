====================
1.2.0
====================
-	New widget: Rolling week! A history of the past week (default) showing your new vs. closed tickets per day. Available in line- and bar chart widgets.
	Configure the amount of days and the title of the widget in the bootstrap ('Widget.RollingWeek.daysOfHistory' and 'Widget.RollingWeek.title').
-	New widget: Queue Health! A history of the past week (default) showing the average days a ticket in your queues is open.
	Configure the amount of days and the title of the widget in the bootstrap ('Widget.QueueHealth.daysOfHistory' and 'Widget.QueueHealth.title').
-	New widget: Amount of Tickets that violate their SLA!
-	Restructured the Dashboard layout. You can now re-order the dashboard in any way you want :-)
-	iPad is now handled as desktop, not mobile.
-	Queue Health now shows the amount of overdue tickets.
-	Accounts show max 4 instead of 10 records, preventing messing up of the grid.
-	The dashboard view is now being cached. After the data has been (re-)fetched the cache gets invalidated and the dashboards rebuilt. No more half-full dashboards!
-	The date and time of the last import are shown in the title bar.
-	Fixed issue that would cause errors when fetching more then 500 tickets.
-	Cronjob now properly logs errors that occur in queries to the Autotask API, like invalid credentials or wrong domain for the autotask user.
-	The bootstrap now contains an explanation on which API locations to choose.
-	Added link to "View Dashboard" on the success message after editing a Dashboard.
-	Fixed lame ass error message issue when not selecting any resources or queues at all.
-	Added missing table header on the Dashboard index.

Note: SQL schema update required (upgrade-1.1.1-to-1.2.0.sql)!


====================
1.1.1
====================
-	"Missing Issue Type" now looks for tickets where sub issue type simply isn't set at all (in addition to a custom sub issue type ID).
-	Cronjob is no longer affected by the API limit of 500 tickets and now fetches unlimited amounts of tickets.
-	Cronjob now logs the creation of Accounts, Queues, Resources, Ticket Statuses and Sub Issue Types.
-	In addition to a single sub issue type ID you can now add multiple ID's. Set 'MIT.subIssueTypeIds' in your bootstrap.php. Please use this setting as 'MIT.subIssueTypeId' will become deprecrated in the future.
-	Kill Rate didn't take into account the unassigned tickets, neither did accounts and "Missing Issue Type".
-	Added a check on the SOAP extension. If SOAP isn't available it's being logged to both the error.log and cronjob.log.
-	Added a check on your API credentials. If you forget to enter something it's being logged to both the error.log and cronjob.log.
-	Fixed empty array checking in the list views (queues, resources, ticket statuses, sub issue types).
-	Fixed empty array checking in the Ticket Model.
-	Fixed typo in the label of unknown queue names in the queue list.


====================
