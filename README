Campai Autotask Dashboards
==============================
Slick ticket performance dashboard to provide your teams with an at-a-glance status overview. Great for big screens and a perfect show-off for visiting customers. All dashboards are configurable and compatible with mobile and tablet screen sizes.


==============================
Requirements
==============================
To use this application you'll need:
- a Webserver with a running CakePHP 2.x project (For details on how to install CakePHP, please see this manual: http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/installation.html).
- an Autotask user that has API access.


==============================
Installation
==============================

1.	Copy the files in this directory into app/Plugin/Autotask.
2.	Load the Plugin by editing your app/Config/bootstrap.php like so:
	------------------------------
	CakePlugin::load( 'Autotask', array(
			'bootstrap' => true
		,	'routes' => true
	) );
	------------------------------
3.	Copy app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/bootstrap.php.default to app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/bootstrap.php and enter your Autotask credentials (and optionally other values to find interesting).
4.	Run app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/Schema/autotask.sql to setup your database.
5.	Setup the cronjob that imports your Autotask data:
	------------------------------
	sh </path/to/your/cake/installation/>/lib/CakeConsole/cake -app /path/to/your/application/folder/app Autotask.import_from_autotask
	------------------------------


==============================
Upgrading
==============================
1.	Copy the files in this directory into app/Plugin/Autotask.
2.	Run the upgrade SQL statement depending on which version you were running.
	For instance, when you have 1.2 installed, use the file /app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/Schema/upgrade-1.2.0-to-1.3.0.sql.
	If you want to get a clean start, use the autotask-1.3.0.sql file to setup the default database.
3.	Delete the cache created by the existing dashboards. If you open up the console of the VM (or your server) you can remove all cached files with (path may differ):
	rm -f /var/www/app/tmp/cache/models/* /var/www/app/tmp/cache/persistent/* /var/www/app/tmp/cache/views/*


==============================
Getting started
==============================
After you've installed the plugin and the cronjob has run (at least once) you'll have all data from Autotask present. You know the cronjob has run
when there's a cronjob.log in your app/tmp/logs folder.

The only thing you'll need to do now is:
- Specify the names of the queues (/autotask/queues)
- Specify the names of the Ticket Statuses (/autotask/ticketstatuses)

Now you can go ahead and create your first dashboard at /autotask/dashboards :-)
