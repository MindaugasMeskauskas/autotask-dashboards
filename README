Campai Autotask Dashboards
==============================
Slick ticket performance dashboard to provide your teams with an at-a-glance status overview. Great for big screens and a perfect show-off for visiting customers. All dashboards are configurable and compatible with mobile and tablet screen sizes.


==============================
Requirements
==============================
To use this application you'll need:
- a Webserver with a running CakePHP 2.x project (For details on how to install CakePHP, please see this manual: http://book.cakephp.org/2.0/en/installation.html).
- an Autotask user that has API access.


==============================
Installation
==============================

1.	Copy the files in this directory into app/Plugin/Autotask.
2.	Load the Plugin by editing your app/Config/bootstrap.php like so:
	------------------------------
	CakePlugin::load( 'Autotask', array(
			'bootstrap' => true
		,	'routes' => true
	) );
	------------------------------
3.	Copy app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/bootstrap.php.default to app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/bootstrap.php and enter your Autotask credentials and the subissuetype ID.
4.	Run app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/Schema/autotask.sql to setup your database.
5.	Setup the cronjob that imports your Autotask data:
	------------------------------
	sh /path/to/your/cake/installation/cake -app /path/to/your/application/folder/app Autotask.import_from_autotask
	------------------------------


==============================
Upgrading
==============================
1.	Copy the files in this directory into app/Plugin/Autotask.
2.	Run app/Plugin/Autotask/Config/Schema/update-X.sql to setup your database (choose appropriate upgrade file).


==============================
Getting started
==============================
After you've installed the plugin and the cronjob has run (at least once) you'll have all data from Autotask present. You know the cronjob has run
when there's a cronjob.log in your app/tmp/logs folder.

The only thing you'll need to do now is:
- Specify the names of the queues (/autotask/queues)
- Specify the names of the Ticket Statuses (/autotask/ticketstatuses)

Now you can go ahead and create your first dashboard at /autotask/dashboards :-)
